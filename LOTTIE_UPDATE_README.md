# Lottie Animation Update for EventCraft Pro

## What Has Been Implemented

I have successfully updated the EventCraft Pro homepage to replace the complex CSS-animated character with a new image-based hero section that includes Lottie animations. Here's what has been changed:

### 1. Template Updates (`templates/index.html`)
- **Replaced** the complex CSS-animated character with a clean image-based hero section
- **Added** Lottie animation support using the `lottie-web` library
- **Implemented** interactive controls for animation playback (play/pause, speed control, reset)
- **Enhanced** hover effects and interactions for the hero image
- **Maintained** floating emoji elements around the image for visual appeal

### 2. New Lottie Animation (`static/js/lottie-animation.json`)
- **Created** a custom Lottie animation file with subtle enhancement effects
- **Includes** glow effects and sparkle animations that overlay the hero image
- **Provides** smooth, professional animations that enhance the user experience

### 3. Enhanced JavaScript Functionality
- **LottieAnimationController** class for managing all animations
- **Interactive controls** for users to control animation playback
- **Responsive design** that works on all device sizes
- **Smooth transitions** and hover effects

## How to Replace the Image

### Option 1: Replace the Existing Image
1. **Navigate** to the `images/` folder in your project
2. **Replace** the existing `homelottie.png` file with your new image
3. **Ensure** the new image has the same filename: `homelottie.png`
4. **Recommended** image dimensions: 400x400px or larger (will scale automatically)

### Option 2: Use a Different Image Name
1. **Place** your new image in the `images/` folder
2. **Update** the image source in `templates/index.html` line 201:
   ```html
   <img src="/images/YOUR_NEW_IMAGE_NAME.png" alt="EventCraft Pro Hero" class="hero-lottie-image">
   ```

## Image Requirements

For the best experience, your new image should:
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or WebP
- **Dimensions**: At least 400x400px (will scale responsively)
- **Style**: Match the EventCraft Pro design aesthetic
- **Content**: Represent the concept of event planning, invitations, or celebrations

## Customization Options

### Animation Speed
You can adjust the default animation speed by modifying the `speed` property in the `LottieAnimationController` class.

### Floating Elements
The floating emojis can be customized by editing the HTML in the hero section:
```html
<div class="floating-elements">
    <div class="floating-element element-1">üéâ</div>
    <div class="floating-element element-2">üéÇ</div>
    <!-- Add more elements as needed -->
</div>
```

### Lottie Animation
The Lottie animation file (`static/js/lottie-animation.json`) can be customized using Adobe After Effects or other Lottie-compatible tools.

## Testing

After making changes:
1. **Refresh** your browser to see the new animations
2. **Test** on different devices and screen sizes
3. **Verify** that all interactive controls work properly
